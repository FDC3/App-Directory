# App-Directory
The FDC3 App Directory - specifications and implementations.

The FDC App Directory provides trusted identity for financial desktop apps. This identity can be used to prevent spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks when apps communicate with one another and exchange data. The App Directory also enables service discovery.  Apps are registered with a declaration of the intents and context data that can be used when interoperating.

OpenFin has provided a reference implementation at https://app-directory.openfin.co/.  We expect organizations to stand up their own registries as needed, as well as federating with the public registry.
