# App-Directory
The FDC3 App Directory - specifications and implementations.

The App Directory provides trusted identity for financial desktop apps. This identity can be used to prevent data leakage when apps communicate with one another and exchange data.
The App Registry also enables service discovery.  Apps are registered with a declaration of the intents and context data that can be used in interoping with them.
Openfin has provided a reference implementation at https://app-directory.openfin.co/.
We expect organizations to stand up their own registries as needed, as well as federating with the public registry.
